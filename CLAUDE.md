# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server using Astro
- `npm run build` - Build for production using Astro
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Architecture Overview

This is a modern marketing website built with **Astro**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The application uses:

- **Astro** as the meta-framework for static site generation with islands architecture
- **React** components with client-side hydration (client:load, client:visible directives)
- **Astro Content Collections** for structured content management (articles, pillars, clusters)
- **shadcn/ui** components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** with extensive custom animations and premium color palette
- **Framer Motion** for advanced animations
- **Cloudinary** for optimized image/video delivery

### Key Architecture Patterns

- **Astro Islands**: React components hydrate only when needed with client: directives
- **Content Collections**: Structured content management with Zod schemas for articles/pillars
- **Component Organization**: Components grouped by feature in subdirectories  
- **Performance Optimizations**: Client-side hydration controls, progressive loading hooks
- **Premium Animations**: Extensive Apple-inspired keyframes and transitions

### Routing

Astro file-based routing with the following key pages:
- `/` - Main landing page
- `/agents-automations` - AI agents and automation services
- `/agents-automations/speed-to-lead` - Speed to lead specific page
- `/kenniscentrum` - Knowledge center hub
- `/kenniscentrum/[pillar]` - Dynamic pillar pages (ai-automatisering, ai-marketing, ai-sales)
- `/kenniscentrum/[pillar]/[cluster]` - Dynamic cluster pages within pillars
- `/kenniscentrum/[slug]` - Individual article pages
- `/lead-engine` - Lead engine product page
- `/inbox-to-meeting` - Inbox to meeting feature page

### Content System

Uses Astro Content Collections with three main types:
- **Articles** (`artikelen`): Blog posts/guides with pillar/cluster associations
- **Pillars** (`pillars`): Main knowledge hub pages (ai-automatisering, ai-marketing, ai-sales)  
- **Clusters** (`clusters`): Content groupings within pillars

All content is typed with Zod schemas and supports SEO metadata, featured content, and cross-references.

### Styling & Animations

- **Tailwind CSS** with extensive custom configuration including:
  - Custom color palette (premium blacks, ScailUp brand colors)
  - 50+ custom keyframe animations (Apple-inspired, cinematic effects)
  - Comprehensive safelist to preserve animation classes
- **Custom CSS Variables**: `--premium-black`, `--premium-gray`, `--scailup-blue`, etc.
- **Animation System**: Apple-style smooth transitions, premium hover effects, GPU-accelerated animations

### Build Configuration

- **Astro Config**: Static output with React and Tailwind integrations
- **Vite Integration**: Path aliases (`@/*` → `./src/*`), global definitions
- **TypeScript**: Multiple tsconfig files (app, node) with path mapping
- **Performance**: Optimized for static generation with selective hydration

## Important Notes

- This is a **Lovable.dev project** that can be edited via their platform or locally
- Uses **Astro's islands architecture** - only hydrate React components when needed
- **Content-driven**: Articles and knowledge content managed through Astro Content Collections
- **Performance-focused**: Client directives control hydration timing (client:load vs client:visible)
- Development includes `lovable-tagger` for component identification

## ScailUp Brand Colors

The standard ScailUp brand colors defined in tailwind.config.ts:
- **Primary Gradient**: `from-blue-500 to-blue-400` (LinkedIn-style)
- **Brand Colors**: `bg-scailup-blue` (#2196F3), `bg-scailup-cyan` (#21CBF3)
- **Background Tints**: `via-blue-900/20` for subtle blue tinting
- **Premium Palette**: Custom blacks (`premium-black`, `premium-gray`) and silvers

Use `from-blue-500 to-blue-400` as the default accent color for new components unless specifically requested otherwise.

## Buildrs Business Model

**Buildrs = AI-first Platform + Agency for B2B Service Providers**

We help businesses that run on sales calls, marketing, and client projects make their processes smarter and faster with AI-driven workflows and agents.

### Two-Layer Proposition:

#### 1. Engines (Software – SaaS)
Multi-tenant software modules that are scalable and serve as core products of our platform:
- **Lead Engine** → automatic lead generation, enrichment and outbound via email
- **CRM (basic → advanced)** → customer management and follow-up
- **Marketing Engine (later)** → content workflows, SEO, reporting
- **Project Management Engine (later)** → task and client project automation

These engines are repeatable, scalable and usage-based priced.

#### 2. Custom Agents & Workflows (Agency)
Custom-built AI agents or automations, built with n8n and various APIs/tools, specifically tailored to the client's business:
- Can run **standalone** (e.g. on Google Sheets/Airtable)
- Or seamlessly **integrated into our Buildrs Platform**
- Examples: LinkedIn outbound agent, proposal generator, reporting automation, content repurposing agent

These are productized but custom, usually with a one-time setup fee, and optionally a monthly fee if they run integrated in our platform.

### How We Work:

**Analysis & Intake:** Discuss client workflow and identify biggest time wasters or growth barriers.

**Choice: Platform or Standalone Agent:**
- **Platform integration:** agent runs within our Buildrs platform → better experience, dashboards, usage-based pricing
- **Standalone agent:** agent runs separately via Google Sheets, Airtable or own stack → one-time price, exportable, full client ownership

**Implementation:** 
- Engines are immediately deployable (multi-tenant SaaS)
- Custom agents we build in 1-2 weeks, with clear deliverables
- Often deliver simple sheet-connection first if easiest for client, integrate deeper later

**Handover & Ownership:**
- Clients always retain ownership of their agent/workflow
- Standalone agent → we deliver blueprint + documentation so they can host it themselves
- Platform → everything runs centrally, but we ensure their agent remains exportable

### Why This Is Unique:

- **AI-first:** We don't build "another CRM" but a platform where AI and automation are at the core
- **Hybrid model:** SaaS + Agency → scalable software + high-value custom work
- **Client ownership:** workflows are exportable/self-hostable → no lock-in, but plug-and-play integration in Buildrs
- **Focus on B2B service providers:** marketing agencies, sales agencies, consultants, financial services → all organizations that rely heavily on outbound, reporting and project workflows

### Current Status:
- **Engines:** Lead Engine + basic CRM live
- **Agents:** Starting with 3 core agents covering end-to-end B2B sales funnel:
  - Lead Engine – Cold outbound via email
  - Custom LinkedIn Agent – Cold outbound via LinkedIn  
  - Proposal Generator – Closing agent

**TL;DR:** Buildrs = AI-first platform + agency for B2B service providers. Engines = scalable SaaS modules. Agents = custom workflows, exportable or integrated. Client chooses: standalone as productized agent, or within Buildrs platform. Unique: hybrid model, no lock-in, AI at core, B2B service provider focus.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUPABASE SAFETY RULES

**🚨 NEVER RESET SUPABASE DATABASE**

The following operations are **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**:
- `DROP DATABASE`
- `DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE`  
- `TRUNCATE ALL TABLES`
- `DELETE FROM table WITHOUT WHERE CLAUSE`
- Any operation that wipes/resets the entire database
- Any operation that drops production tables without explicit user confirmation

**✅ SAFE OPERATIONS ONLY:**
- SELECT queries to read data
- INSERT with specific data
- UPDATE with proper WHERE clauses
- CREATE TABLE (after user confirmation)
- ALTER TABLE to add columns (after user confirmation)

**🔐 Supabase MCP Server Configuration:**
- URL: https://cwgbgvulfiwbydpinbqf.supabase.co
- MCP Config: `~/.config/claude-code/mcp/supabase-config.json`
- Environment: `~/.config/claude-code/mcp/.env.supabase`

**⚡ Usage Examples:**
```
"Show me all tables in my Supabase database"
"Create a new table called 'leads' with columns: id, email, name, created_at"
"Insert test data into the leads table" 
"Select all data from the users table"
"Update user with id=1 to set status='active'"
```

**❌ NEVER EVER SAY:**
```
"Let me reset your database"
"I'll drop all tables and start fresh"  
"Should I truncate all data?"
```
- We heten GEEN scailUp maar Buildrs
- Performance van de website is super belangrijk.
